# Progress Log

This document maintains a chronological record of project milestones, completed tasks, and current status. Each entry includes timestamps, descriptions of changes, and outcomes.

## 2025-09-27

### 14:37 - Initial Build Error Resolution
- **Action**: Encountered build error with @sveltejs/adapter-static due to dynamic routes. Added `export const prerender = true` to `src/routes/+layout.server.ts`.
- **Outcome**: Build succeeded, static site generated in "build" directory.
- **Notes**: Resolved prerendering issues for static generation.

### 14:40 - Styling Issues Investigation
- **Action**: Identified Tailwind CSS not loading in build. Added PostCSS configuration with `@tailwindcss/postcss`.
- **Outcome**: Build completed with compiled CSS (2.99 kB instead of directives).
- **Notes**: Fixed CSS processing for production builds.

### 14:42 - Page Simplification for Debugging
- **Action**: Removed confetti onMount, decorative overlays, and ThrelteScene from +page.svelte. Changed image card opacity from 0 to 100.
- **Outcome**: Cleaner page with visible image cards, responsive sizing (256px-320px based on screen size).
- **Notes**: Eliminated blocking overlays and hidden content.

### 14:50 - Modal Functionality Implementation
- **Action**: Created `src/lib/stores/modal.ts` for shared modal state. Updated ThrelteScene to use store for modal opening. Added Modal component to +page.svelte.
- **Outcome**: 3D image planes now open modal with selected images and descriptions.
- **Notes**: Removed confetti from modal clicks to prevent interference.

### 14:58 - Modal Styling Fixes
- **Action**: Replaced Tailwind classes with inline styles in Modal.svelte to ensure CSS generation. Added hidden div with modal classes to +page.svelte for Tailwind detection.
- **Outcome**: Modal displays correctly with semi-transparent backdrop (bg-opacity-50).
- **Notes**: Resolved CSS purging issues in dev and production.

### 17:04 - 3D Physics Integration
- **Action**: Installed @threlte/rapier for physics. Added 3D text letters "KANIGNAN" with RigidBody and AutoColliders. Implemented explosion effect on confetti button click.
- **Outcome**: Letters tumble with physics and explode when crib is clicked.
- **Notes**: Used client-only rendering to avoid prerender errors.

### 17:07 - Prerender Error Fixes
- **Action**: Added `export const prerender = false` to +page.server.ts and wrapped ThrelteScene in `{#if browser}`.
- **Outcome**: Dev server runs without DOM access errors.
- **Notes**: 3D scene renders client-side only.

### 17:16 - Event Handler Updates
- **Action**: Changed `on:click` to `onclick` for Threlte event handling. Removed `interactivity()` import.
- **Outcome**: 3D interactions work without prerender issues.
- **Notes**: Updated to Threlte v8 API syntax.

### 17:26 - Modal Backdrop Adjustment
- **Action**: Changed modal backdrop from `bg-opacity-75` to `bg-opacity-50` for more semi-transparency.
- **Outcome**: Lighter overlay allowing more background visibility.
- **Notes**: Improved visual design.

### 17:49 - Modal Store Integration
- **Action**: Created modal store and integrated with ThrelteScene for opening modals from 3D scene.
- **Outcome**: Clicking 3D image planes opens modal with confetti effects.
- **Notes**: Centralized modal state management.

### 17:50 - Greeting Text Update
- **Action**: Updated greeting text to match HTML inspiration: "blows raspberries ðŸ¥º".
- **Outcome**: More playful greeting message.
- **Notes**: Enhanced user experience.

### 18:00 - CSS Generation Fixes
- **Action**: Added hidden div with modal classes to ensure Tailwind includes them in build.
- **Outcome**: Modal styles generated correctly.
- **Notes**: Resolved production CSS issues.

### 21:09 - Rapier Physics Setup
- **Action**: Installed @threlte/rapier. Added physics imports and letter references.
- **Outcome**: Physics engine ready for 3D text.
- **Notes**: Prepared for tumbling letters implementation.

### 21:10 - 3D Text Letters Creation
- **Action**: Added 8 RigidBody components with Text components spelling "KANIGNAN" in hotpink.
- **Outcome**: 3D letters positioned above scene with physics.
- **Notes**: Letters ready for tumbling and explosion effects.

### 21:11 - Explosion Implementation
- **Action**: Modified spawnConfetti to apply impulses to letter RigidBodies for explosion effect.
- **Outcome**: Clicking crib explodes letters with random forces.
- **Notes**: Interactive physics-based animation.

### 21:12 - Memory Bank Creation
- **Action**: Created memory_bank folder with progress_log.md, decisions_made.md, pivots.md, qa_summary.md, and learned_from_human_dev.md.
- **Outcome**: Comprehensive project documentation established.
- **Notes**: Systematic tracking of decisions, progress, and learnings.

## 2025-09-30

### 13:48 - Dev Quest Documentation
- **Action**: Created "dev_quest.md" compiling all user instructions and development requests into a comprehensive quest log, excluding debugging and error analysis.
- **Outcome**: Complete chronicle of project evolution from initial 3D name spelling to full interactive experience.
- **Notes**: Serves as narrative summary of all feature requests and implementations.

### 13:55 - Dev Quest Expansion
- **Action**: Added additional user instructions and questions to existing "dev_quest.md" document, expanding from 11 to 16 quests.
- **Outcome**: Comprehensive collection of all development requests throughout the entire project lifecycle.
- **Notes**: Maintains chronological quest progression while preserving existing documentation.

### 14:08 - Complete Dev Quest Compilation
- **Action**: Added all remaining user questions and suggestions as inputs to "dev_quest.md", expanding from 16 to 30 quests total.
- **Outcome**: Exhaustive chronicle of every user instruction, question, and suggestion from the entire conversation.
- **Notes**: Preserves existing content while ensuring no user input is omitted from the development quest log.

### 14:10 - Questions & Suggestions Section Completion
- **Action**: Expanded the "## Questions & Suggestions" section in dev_quest.md with comprehensive collection of all 48 user inputs, questions, and suggestions from the entire development process.
- **Outcome**: Complete reference of all direct user communications organized by development phases.
- **Notes**: Provides searchable reference for all feature requests and collaborative inputs.
